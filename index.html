      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>I have been freelancing as a Front End Web Developer since 1997!
        <br> My first attempt at creating was using a software program by Microsoft called Frontpage.
        <br>It was frustrating because the software wouldn't let me do some of the things I wanted to do. I thought there must be a better way.
        <br>I then taught myself to code the "old school" way. Through the years I have created different types of websites including:</p>
      <center>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>Real Estate</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Lawn Care Services</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Vaping Products</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Movie Production</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </center>

        <p class="code-skill-description">I created my very first website "old school" style by hand coding with HTML. It was for a very special Realtor friend of mine and wanted
        it to be unique. Thinking back, it was it kind of bizzare, but at the time it was cool.</p>
